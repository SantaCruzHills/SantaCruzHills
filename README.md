### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  This is an impulsive small project i want to start. 
Ever since I've moved in the hills of Santa Cruz at the age of 3 
I've noticed all the nice cars and the enthusiastic drivers. 
Numerous people come here from sometimes over an hour away 
just to drive our roads at all times of the days. a day doesnt 
go by where i dont see another car going as fast as he/she can
possibly go. and when i grew up, the mountain grew on me. and now 
I'm one of the drivers who exist on these road and I want a way 
where anyone can see what others have done on this road
